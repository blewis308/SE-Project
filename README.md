# How to use

Select a new file by clicking on "New File" button on bottom left

Files selected must be .jpg .jpeg or similar image files

Once the image is loaded, "File Loaded" indicator will activate and a preview may appear. If a preview is unable to be loaded, you will be prompted to either continue or abort the process. 

To select a different image, simply click "New File" again or to remove the current image click "Clear File".

# Encrypting

Select the "Key" text box in the bottom middle. This is the 24 character key that will be used to encrypt the selected file.
> **Important**: The key used should be kept secret and never shared with anyone. Treat this as a credit card or bank password.

If the encryption is successful, a save prompt will appear; choose an appropriate name and location to save your encrypted image.

# Decrypting

Select the "Key" text box in the bottom middle and input the same 24 character key you encrypted the image with.

If the wrong key was input, you will be presented with an error. Double check that the key you input was the correct key.

If the correct key is input, a save prompt will appear; choose an appropriate name and location to save your decrypted image.
